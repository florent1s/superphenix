# Permissions Documentation

## Glossary

- **Permission**: A single right on one or more products.
- **PermissionSet**: A grouping of permissions.

## How Permissions Work

Permission management uses a group-based system.
A group is associated with one or more PermissionSets. Groups are cumulative.
A user can be assigned to one or more groups.
If assigned to multiple groups, the user benefits from all permissions granted by all their groups combined.

Permissions and PermissionSets are divided into two categories:
those associated with an **organization** and those associated with a **project**.

## Predefined vs. custom groups

**Predefined groups** are Owner, Admin, Billing and Developer, defined by the `PredefinedGroups`
catalog in `pkg/base/v1/schema_default.go`. Each is persisted with its catalog key (`owner`,
`admin`, `billing`, `developer`) in `groups.predefined_key`. The key never changes, so the display
name can be relabelled without losing track of the group. Predefined groups cannot be edited or
deleted through the API (403) and do not count against the organization's IAM group quota.

**Custom groups** have a `NULL` `predefined_key`, which is what keeps them out of the reconciler.
`POST /v1/organization/{orgaId}/iam/group/{groupId}/duplicate` returns an editable copy of any
group, with no key.

### Keeping predefined groups up to date

Each organization records the catalog version it is aligned on in
`organizations.predefined_catalog_version`. On API startup, and from
`POST /admin/permission/update-schema`, the reconciler selects the organizations below
`PredefinedCatalogVersion`, pushes the default Permify schema, then upserts every catalog entry by
key: missing ones are created, existing ones overwritten with the catalog's name and PermissionSets.
The version is recorded only once every group of that organization succeeded, so a failure is
retried on the next pass. Pass `{"force": true}` to the admin endpoint to re-run against every
organization regardless of its version.

Adding a PermissionSet to a predefined group is therefore:

1. Declare the relation in `pkg/base/v1/schema/schema_default.perm`.
2. Add the constant in `pkg/base/v1/permissionSet/permissionSet.go` and its entity mapping.
3. Add it to the relevant entry of `PredefinedGroups`.
4. Bump `PredefinedCatalogVersion`.

Every live organization picks the change up on the next API start.

### Internal PermissionSets

These PermissionSets are not visible to API users.
They define minimum rights when a user joins an organization (`SpxMember`)
and maximum rights for organization owners (`SpxOwner`).

| PermissionSet | Associated Permissions                                                        |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SpxOwner      | Grants all permissions on the organization and all its projects               |
| SpxMember     | Grants the `OrganizationRead` permission                                      |
