# SFS-BAAS

![Version: 0.2.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.2.1-informational?style=flat-square)

This Helm Chart is used by the self-service ArgoCDs of Superphénix to create backup policies.

### Resource names

Resources have a unique ID (see [this](#creating-a-new-resource)) and a name.

Names do not have to be unique across resources and can be identical. They are simply used as a tag to be filtered and found more easily.

To set a name on a resource, use the `.name` value.

> [!note]
> Names **must** begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores, up to 63 characters each.

### Setting a resource location

Resources are located within a specific AZ (or *availability zone*). AZs are represented by a unique code.

To deploy your resource in a specific AZ, simply use the code in the `.location` value of the resource.
